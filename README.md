# Dominion Engine

A small collection of code for playing around with Haskell
and trying to build an engine for simulating Dominion games.
Potentially at some point to test run bots, as well as
fledging domain design muscles.

## Prior Art

Two excellent simulators are out there that implement much more cards,
much more reliably and have loads of strategies defined.
